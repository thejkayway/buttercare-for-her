## Watching movies / playing videogames
Plex is the app Jonathan uses to stream movies and TV. It's installed on the Playstation. To watch movies/TV or play video games, you'll need to turn on all the devices.

*The only buttons you should need to turn everything on and off*

1. Find the black Yamaha remote and white Benq remote.
    - The white remote turns the projector on and off (the only buttons you'll use are the red and green power buttons at the top).
    - The black remote turns on the AV receiver (big black box on the bottom shelf of the media console). The relevant buttons on this remote are the top-right power button and the white volume buttons along the middle of the right side.
    - *A special note are the grey "Input" arrow buttons to the left of the volume buttons. If you can't get any video to come through after turning all the devices on, the receiver may not be tuned to the PS4 channel. Press up or down arrows until the receiver display says "PS4".*
2. Retrieve a Playstation controller from the coffee table drawer.
    - If they need to be charged, there's a micro-USB cable to the left of the media console, on the floor.
3. Turn on the projector, the receiver, and the playstation.
4. Navigate the PS4 menus according to your heart's desire.
    - Plex is in the main screen folder "TV & Video"

## Coffee
### Drip (Downstairs)
The drip machine downstairs has instructions taped to the equipment. In short:
1. Scoop out the desired amount of coffee (~1 scoop per cup), place in hopper of grinder
2. Push cycle button on grinder; should automatically stop itself when done (push cycle button again if not)
3. Pour coffee grounds into the metal filter cone of the coffee maker
4. Fill water reservoir to desired level
    - Note that the coffee maker will always use all of the water in the reservoir. Do not add more water than you want cups of coffee.
5. Ensure carafe is in place with lid secured
6. Select `CLASSIC` mode.
    - If brewing less than 4 cups of coffee, also select `1-4 CUP` (remember that this is a flavor adjustment and the coffee maker will use all water in the reservoir regardless of this setting)
7. Press `BREW`

### Espresso (Upstairs)

## Gym
Feel free to use the exercise equipment. We have a power rack with a bench, a rowing machine, and dumbbells.

## Bike Pump
We have an electric bike pump on the floor near the trash can in the gym (right next to the door). Turn it on, adjust the display to the desired PSI, attach it to your tires, and hold the trigger until it stops itself.
