Thank you so much for taking care of Lady Buttermilk while we're away. Feel free to help yourself to any food/drinks/snacks/etc around the house ðŸ˜Š

This page has the things we're asking you to do, the other pages (in the header) are nice-to-know stuff that might make things more pleasant.

# Buttercare Tasks

Caring for Lady Buttermilk involves completing a few recurring quests:
1. Filling her [water](#water)
2. Checking that her [food machine](#food) is still full of food and powered on
3. Checking that her automatic [litterbox](#litter) has been working
4. Loving her

We'd also really appreciate it if you'd water the plants, roughly once a week.

## Water
She has three water sources:
* a water bowl in the walk-in closet near her food
* a water bowl by the big tub in the master bathroom
* a glass of water on the bedside table

Refill them as needed, give them a rinse every couple days to prevent biofilm.

## Food
She has an automatic food machine. She may try to convince you that she hasnâ€™t been fed. 99% of the time she is lying, but there was one time it didn't go off and she will never forget that.

If sheâ€™s being insanely insistent, check to see if the machine is on (text will be visible on the display). If it is, you can either watch the machine when it goes off (at 6am, 1pm, or 11pm, give or take an hour due to daylight savings), or [trigger a meal](#manually-trigger-a-meal) and see if it works.

If the machine isnâ€™t on, it likely ran out of batteries. Spares are in the big green cabinet by the upstairs bathroom door, in a basket on one of the upper left shelves.

### Manually trigger a meal

1. Press `OK` so that the screen backlight comes on
2. Press the down arrow two times in moderately quick succession (you will hear a beep with each press)
3. The machine should now dispense about half a meal

## Litter
She has an automatic litter box so you shouldnâ€™t have to do anything besides make sure itâ€™s still working. If thereâ€™s no waste in the litter bed youâ€™re good.

If there is, the waste drawer may need to be emptied (should go 2-3 weeks without needing to be emptied).

To empty the waste collection drawer, gently pull the step of the litter box forward â€” the step itself is the handle of a drawer. Tie up the bag and throw it in the trash. Replace bag (spares are behind litter box).

If it does seem broken, contact us. We have a regular litter box and a scoop tucked away somewhere.

## Plants
The plants just need water roughly once a week. The watering can is on the bottom shelf of the built-in bookshelf in the living room.

If the plants on the top shelf of that built-in are hard to reach with the watering can, there's a weird turkey baster thing next to where the can sits that Jonathan uses to spray water onto them.

1. Gently poke the soil with your finger. If it's damp, do not water. Otherwise go to step 2.
2. Water until the soil gets squishy and damp, but stop before it gets soupy. Less is usually more.
    - All of the plants are either in plastic nursery pots or have drainage trays. It might be easiest to bring the plants you can (don't move the huge vining ones) to the sink, where you can really soak them and just let them drip. This is relatively foolproof, but more work.
    - If you want to water in the sink:
        - For nursery pot plants, take them out first, water them, let them drip, put them back.
        - For built-in drainage tray plants, water them in the pot, let the excess collect in the drainage tray for a few minutes, then slightly tilt the whole pot to pour a little excess water out of the drainage tray. Then put it back.
