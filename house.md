# In Case of Emergency
## Electrical breaker boxes
There are two breaker boxes:
1. In the gym. This controls all electricity upstairs, the water heater, and the gym.
2. In the downstairs dining area. This controls all electricity in the theater, downstairs dining area, kitchen, downstairs bathroom, and downstairs bedroom.

## Water shutoff
The whole-house water shutoff is behind a square white plastic wall panel beneath the bikes in the downstairs hallway. If you don't need whole-house water shutoff, each faucet/toilet/etc has its own shutoff.

## Fire extinguishers
There are two fire extinguishers:
1. In the upstairs kitchen, in the alcove on the floor to the right of the fridge.
2. In the downstairs kitchen, underneath the sink.

# Adjusting AC / Heat
## Upstairs
Upstairs has central air. There's a nest thermostat upstairs by the hall bathroom. You can override the upper and lower temperature settings. They'll reset back to scheduled temperatures every night at 10pm and every morning at 10am. If that gets annoying, text Jonathan and he can change the schedule.

## Downstairs
Downstairs has no AC but does have baseboard heaters. There are three thermostats:
* by the downstairs dining table, controlling the theater, kitchen, and downstairs bathroom
* over the toolbench in the gym, controlling that room
* in the guest bedroom, controlling that room

> :warning: **Before adjusting baseboard heat**:
>
> Make sure nothing is touching any of the baseboard heaters!
>
> In particular, make sure the curtains in the guest bedroom are pulled to the far left and are not touching the heater!

# Garbage and Recycling
The outdoor garbage and recycling bins are in the gravel parking area downstairs. Trash day is every Tuesday, recycling is every other Tuesday. The pickup location is across the street from the gravel lot, by the wood railing and the garden plots.

## Upstairs Garbage Bags
New garbage bags are in a little alcove inside the garbage can and along the back, visible only after you remove the previous bag. If this alcove runs out, more bags are on the floor of the pantry on the far left.

## Downstairs Garbage Bags
New garbage bags are under the sink

# Compost
We have a small indoor bin (on the right side of the upstairs kitchen trash) and a larger 4 gallon outdoor bin on the front porch.

When the indoor bin gets full, you can remove the green bin from inside the metal shell and dump it into the larger bin. Rinse the green indoor bin and when it's dry, new compostable liner bags are on the floor of the pantry to the far left.

Compost gets picked up every other Monday, same week as recycling. Pickup area is on the bottom step of our front steps.
