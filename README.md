Thank you so much for taking care of Lady Buttermilk while we're away. Feel free to help yourself to any food/drinks/snacks/gaming consoles around the apartment and think hard on food and drink we can treat you to when we return ðŸ˜Š

## Setup
The house key is hidden along the floor of the squat rack.

## Tasks

### Loving her
Optional.

## The Amenities
### Watching movies / playing videogames
Plex is installed on the Playstation. To turn it on you'll need to turn on the projector, turn on the audio-video receiver, turn on the playstation, and open the Plex app in the "TV & Video" folder on the PS4 home screen.

1. Retrieve the black and white remotes from the coffee table drawer.
    - The white remote turns the projector on and off (the only buttons you'll use are the red and green power buttons at the top).
    - The black remote turns on the AV receiver (big black box in the corner sitting on the subwoofer). The relevant buttons on this remote are the top-left power button ("Receiver") and the white "Master Volume" buttons along the middle of the right side.
    - *A special note is the black "HDMI" button near the top right. If you can't get any video to come through after turning all the devices on, the receiver may not be tuned to the PS4 channel. Press "HDMI" until the display says "PS4".*
2. Retrieve a Playstation controller from the coffee table drawer.
    - If they need to be charged, there's a micro-USB cable sticking out of the front of the Playstation.
3. Turn the projector, the receiver, and the playstation on.
4. Navigate the PS4 menus according to your heart's desire.

### Snacks
The weird diagonal cabinet over the microwave has most of our nonrefrigerated snacks, there's protein powder to the right of the microwave, ramen above the fridge, and frozen pizza and various microwave things in the freezer.
