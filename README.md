## Housekeeping

Whenever you're at somebody else's place it can be hard to find the needfuls of daily life, this section should help you find commonly used household items.

### Trash / Recycling / Compost
Trash bags are located under the kitchen sink. Recycling just goes straight into the black wire basket next to the fridge, the compost bin is located underneath the kitchen sink. When any of these are full, the municipal bins are located underneath the front porch. Go outside, take the porch stairs down to the sidewalk, turn left, and walk a couple feet. There will be a door to your left. The "outside" key opens this door. Grey bin is trash, blue bin is recycling, green bin is compost. If the municipal bins are getting full, they get picked up on Tuesdays (recycling and compost get picked up every week, trash every other week).

### Dishwashing
Most things besides the cast iron can just go through the dishwasher. We have little dissolvable detergent pods in a bin under the sink. These go into the dishwasher door, close the pod-cover on the door, and the buttons for the dishwasher are on the top frame of the door.

### Laundry
#### Laundry Bin
For towels, dishrags, and other more gnarly items, there's a black wire bin in the hall closet. For clothes, there should be a white and/or a red mesh laundry hamper set up in the bedroom.

#### Doing Laundry
Our washer and dryer are shared in the basement with the other unit in this buillding. To get to them you have to go outside and into the garden and use the "outside" key to open the side door. Go down the stairs, turn left, take a couple steps, look left and you will see the washer and dryer ahead of you along the outer wall of the basement. You can use our laundry detergent and can tell it apart from the neighbors' detergent because theirs will be some vinegary hippie crap and ours will be good American chemicals from our friends at Dupont, like Gain or Tide.

### Cleaning Supplies
There's a narrow, tall door next to the trash can in the kitchen. Behind that lies a broom and various spray cleaners. There's also a vacuum in the hall coat closet. If you need extra rolls of paper towels, they're under the kitchen sink.

## The Amenities
<a name="media"></a>
### Watching movies / tv / playing videogames
Plex is installed on the Playstation. To turn it on you'll need to turn on the projector, turn on the audio-video receiver, turn on the playstation, and open the Plex app in the "TV & Video" folder on the PS4 home screen.

1. Retrieve the black and white remotes from the coffee table drawer.
    - The white remote turns the projector on and off (the only buttons you'll use are the red and green power buttons at the top).
    - The black remote turns on the AV receiver (big black box in the corner sitting on the subwoofer). The relevant buttons on this remote are the top-left power button ("Receiver") and the white "Master Volume" buttons along the middle of the right side.
    - *A special note is the black "HDMI" button near the top right. If you can't get any video to come through after turning all the devices on, the receiver may not be tuned to the PS4 channel. Press "HDMI" until the display says "PS4".*
2. Retrieve a Playstation controller from the coffee table drawer.
    - If they need to be charged, there's a micro-USB cable sticking out of the front of the Playstation.
3. Turn the projector, the receiver, and the playstation on.
4. Navigate the PS4 menus according to your heart's desire.

### Snacks
The weird diagonal cabinet over the microwave has most of our nonrefrigerated snacks, there's protein powder to the right of the microwave, ramen above the fridge, and frozen pizza and various microwave things in the freezer.
